Now, his isolationist followers are pissed.It doesn t help that the favorite conspiracy theorist of Trump and his followers called the Assad attack on his own people a  false flag  designed to take us to war. According to his followers, Trump fell for it, hook, line and sinker. Or, he was lying to them all along.The Trump of weeks past was firmly against any action in Syria. He even accused President Obama of wanting to wage war in Syria over falling poll numbers. Now that Trump s poll numbers are in a complete tailspin, he desperately attacked Syria.Now that Obama s poll numbers are in tailspin   watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2012He also said that Obama would have had to get congressional approval. Obama tried to, but Trump didn t.The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2013Now that the man who s proven himself to have zero principles is occupying the White House, his rules have changed, but his supporters  haven t. They feel duped.Deep State really pushing for a conflict with Russia. The desperation for a war is unreal. #SyriaHoax #StopWW3 #SyriaStrikes https://t.co/qjQplDt95u  ?/K/aitilyn?

I had a lengthy phone conversation with him last year and after I hung up the phone, I had the same kind of feeling I had after meeting Andrew Breitbart. Like Andrew Breitbart, Sabo s not fighting a conventional war against the left, he s studied them, he knows the dirty tactics they use to win and he s determined to beat them at their own game, even if it means shocking a few Americans along the way. Sabo never got to meet Andrew Breitbart, but always wanted to, as he recalls here:Now a thing about me was I d spent a good three years trying to get sober. In that time I did everything I could to stay the hell away from politics. It was the most peaceful three years of my life. Unfortunately during those three years guys like Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart were really picking up steam. So, because of my absence from the political scene I didn t really know much about them. And what little I did know about Glenn Beck I didn t really like. I remember friends would try turning me on to him but I wasn t into his delivery, too loud, too passionate. Not my deal. Sadly Andrew passed away about the time I decided to get back into the political fray. I never had the privilege to meet him. Everyone says we d of really gotten along. I did however get to meet his crew and they were all stand up people.Glenn Beck interviewed Sabo in 2015 when he was still keeping his face hidden from the public:  One of Sabo s most popular pieces of work was his badass representation of Ted Cruz who he wholeheartedly supported for President.During the campaign, Sabo came after Hillary and Bernie Sanders pretty hard. He focused on plastering his hard-hitting posters in areas where fundraisers or events for Bernie or Hillary were taking place. Sabo wanted to make sure the American public saw Hillary as he saw Hillary:It took him a while to come around to Donald Trump, but eventually he did.Sabo s controversial artwork can be found on posters, t-shirts and bumper stickers at his online store: unsavoryagents.com Here s a video of Sabo replacing a sign in a park bench in LA with his own unique printed message. Notice the guy smoking a crack pipe on the bench the entire time.In 2014, Sabo got a little visit from the Secret Service over his  controversial  posts on Twitter. He certainly didn t handle the interview in the way most Americans would have.:Sabo will be on FOX News  Tucker Carlson show tonight at 9 pm EST. He ll likely discuss the artwork that he plastered all over LA in advance of the Oscars last night.Here are a few of the posters liberal actors found when they arrived on the red carpet.   We can promise you one thing it won t be an interview you ll want to miss \",\n          \"The most infamous characters from Donald Trump s administration are resurfacing and coming back to haunt him. Just a few days ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made an appearance at the Emmys to mock his old boss, and now former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci has made a television appearance as well. Basically, Trump should be terrified if this keeps happening.Anthony Scaramucci s short-lived role in the White House was pure insanity for the entirety of its 11 days. From day one, he became polarizing and controversial, causing several actors to rush at the opportunity to imitate him   including comedian Mario Cantone, who became known for his perfect impersonation of  the Mooch.  Little did Scaramucci know, his memorable time as Communications Director would come back to bite him in the a**.On Friday, Scaramucci appeared on The View, where he was suddenly confronted with a surprise appearance by Cantone, who called Scaramucci his doppelg nger.  Cantone sat right next to Scaramucci and said: Look at this guy! He s my doppelg nger! Scaramucci was more than uncomfortable and tried to get Cantone to stop imitating him by asking semi-serious questions. Scaramucci asked: How bummed were you when I was fired? You were on your way. And then you got shot like a little bird and hit the water. You had to be bummed. Unfortunately for the Mooch, Cantone continued to imitate him and landed this epic diss: You re lucky you re here. You got nothing. Spicer got the EMMYs. You re sitting here with four bleeding heart chiacchierones. Scaramucci tried to be a good sport for the rest of the show, but he was visibly irked by Cantone s portrayal of him as he spoke about his time as Communications Director.You can watch Scaramucci hate every second of this surprise appearance below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 434,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"May 9, 2016\",\n          \"July 24, 2016\",\n          \"September 11, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Now, his isolationist followers are pissed.It doesn t help that the favorite conspiracy theorist of Trump and his followers called the Assad attack on his own people a  false flag  designed to take us to war. According to his followers, Trump fell for it, hook, line and sinker. Or, he was lying to them all along.The Trump of weeks past was firmly against any action in Syria. He even accused President Obama of wanting to wage war in Syria over falling poll numbers. Now that Trump s poll numbers are in a complete tailspin, he desperately attacked Syria.Now that Obama s poll numbers are in tailspin   watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2012He also said that Obama would have had to get congressional approval. Obama tried to, but Trump didn t.The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!  Donald J.

I had a lengthy phone conversation with him last year and after I hung up the phone, I had the same kind of feeling I had after meeting Andrew Breitbart. Like Andrew Breitbart, Sabo s not fighting a conventional war against the left, he s studied them, he knows the dirty tactics they use to win and he s determined to beat them at their own game, even if it means shocking a few Americans along the way. Sabo never got to meet Andrew Breitbart, but always wanted to, as he recalls here:Now a thing about me was I d spent a good three years trying to get sober. In that time I did everything I could to stay the hell away from politics. It was the most peaceful three years of my life. Unfortunately during those three years guys like Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart were really picking up steam. So, because of my absence from the political scene I didn t really know much about them. And what little I did know about Glenn Beck I didn t really like. I remember friends would try turning me on to him but I wasn t into his delivery, too loud, too passionate. Not my deal. Sadly Andrew passed away about the time I decided to get back into the political fray. I never had the privilege to meet him. Everyone says we d of really gotten along. I did however get to meet his crew and they were all stand up people.Glenn Beck interviewed Sabo in 2015 when he was still keeping his face hidden from the public:  One of Sabo s most popular pieces of work was his badass representation of Ted Cruz who he wholeheartedly supported for President.During the campaign, Sabo came after Hillary and Bernie Sanders pretty hard. He focused on plastering his hard-hitting posters in areas where fundraisers or events for Bernie or Hillary were taking place. Sabo wanted to make sure the American public saw Hillary as he saw Hillary:It took him a while to come around to Donald Trump, but eventually he did.Sabo s controversial artwork can be found on posters, t-shirts and bumper stickers at his online store: unsavoryagents.com Here s a video of Sabo replacing a sign in a park bench in LA with his own unique printed message. Notice the guy smoking a crack pipe on the bench the entire time.In 2014, Sabo got a little visit from the Secret Service over his  controversial  posts on Twitter. He certainly didn t handle the interview in the way most Americans would have.:Sabo will be on FOX News  Tucker Carlson show tonight at 9 pm EST. He ll likely discuss the artwork that he plastered all over LA in advance of the Oscars last night.Here are a few of the posters liberal actors found when they arrived on the red carpet.   We can promise you one thing it won t be an interview you ll want to miss \",\n          \"The most infamous characters from Donald Trump s administration are resurfacing and coming back to haunt him. Just a few days ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made an appearance at the Emmys to mock his old boss, and now former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci has made a television appearance as well. Basically, Trump should be terrified if this keeps happening.Anthony Scaramucci s short-lived role in the White House was pure insanity for the entirety of its 11 days. From day one, he became polarizing and controversial, causing several actors to rush at the opportunity to imitate him   including comedian Mario Cantone, who became known for his perfect impersonation of  the Mooch.  Little did Scaramucci know, his memorable time as Communications Director would come back to bite him in the a**.On Friday, Scaramucci appeared on The View, where he was suddenly confronted with a surprise appearance by Cantone, who called Scaramucci his doppelg nger.  Cantone sat right next to Scaramucci and said: Look at this guy! He s my doppelg nger! Scaramucci was more than uncomfortable and tried to get Cantone to stop imitating him by asking semi-serious questions. Scaramucci asked: How bummed were you when I was fired? You were on your way. And then you got shot like a little bird and hit the water. You had to be bummed. Unfortunately for the Mooch, Cantone continued to imitate him and landed this epic diss: You re lucky you re here. You got nothing. Spicer got the EMMYs. You re sitting here with four bleeding heart chiacchierones. Scaramucci tried to be a good sport for the rest of the show, but he was visibly irked by Cantone s portrayal of him as he spoke about his time as Communications Director.You can watch Scaramucci hate every second of this surprise appearance below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 434,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"May 9, 2016\",\n          \"July 24, 2016\",\n          \"September 11, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obama\\u2019s healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBO\\u2019s assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes. \\u201cI think most of the taxes are going to go away,\\u201d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate\\u2019s No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday. \\u201cOur members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue.\\u201d Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed.  Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans\\u2019 healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacare\\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the law\\u2019s taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said.  Some of Obamacare\\u2019s taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.  \\u201cThere\\u2019s no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now,\\u201d Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal. \\u201cThink of me with a Rubik\\u2019s cube, sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to 50,\\u201d McConnell said.  \",\n          \"Crooked Hillary has met her match:  Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund.

By now most of us know that Trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the White House, and there have been far more failures than successes.Now, the White House is joining in on the mounting pressure for Trump to actually do something before his first 100 days come to an end. The Trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if Trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is   and of course they had to lie to make that possible.The White House has just claimed that Congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week, and that the government will be open despite the fact that the Republicans don t have any votes lined up and Congress will only be in session for half the week. According to CNBC: The White House hopes language on a possible health-care deal can come as early as Friday or Saturday, leaving the potential for an agreement next week, a White House official told CNBC. The Senate Budget Committee is assisting with the draft, which would be introduced first in the House. This is absolutely insane, and clearly a response to the fact that Trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first 100 days and the Trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it. In just 4 days, Trump expects the House to vote on health care, examine Trump s tax plan, and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win. That s not going to happen, and the American people know it. Here s the overwhelmingly negative response to Trump and his  accomplishments :      Featured image via Pool / Getty Images\",\n          \"Republicans across the country have been doing all they can to avoid town hall meetings where angry constituents are waiting. But Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) should win some type of award for his despicable excuse.Earlier this week, Gohmert claimed that he hadn t scheduled a town hall meeting to discuss important issues with the people he represents because with all the angry protesters around he s afraid of a shooting like the one that involved Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. But don t worry. This isn t because he s a coward. It s just that he wants to keep his constituents safe. Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety. Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge. However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at Congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed   just as happened there. In a scathing statement, Giffords slammed Gohmert for his cowardly comments and basically told him to grow a pair. She pointed out that her offices were open after her shooting. Giffords added that the representative who took her place during that difficult time also continued to hold town halls rather than hide from the people. Her statement ended by shaming Gohmert and telling him, point blank, to  have some courage. I was shot on a Saturday morning. By Monday morning my offices were open to the public. Ron Barber   at my side that Saturday, who was shot multiple times, then elected to Congress in my stead   held town halls. It s what the people deserve in a representative. In the past year, campaigning for gun safety, I have held over 50 public events. To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage. Face your constituents. Hold town halls. Giffords followed her statement up with a tweet that shared the same message.To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage. Face your constituents. Hold town halls.  Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) February 23, 2017It is also worth noting that Republicans aren t willing to pass legislation that might help control the massive gun problem clutching the United States. They d prefer to continue playing the puppet for the NRA and then hide from the people they re supposed to represent because they re scared that they might get shot. Unbelievable.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images\",\n          \"The New York Daily News is not known for subtlety when it comes to its covers. The snarky newspaper pulled no punches when it came to using its cover to go after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling concentration camps  Holocaust Centers  and invoking Nazi butcher Adolf Hitler when talking about Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Wednesday morning s cover reads: Nazis murdered 2.7 million Jews, gassing 6,000 a day in Auschwtiz alone FORGOTTEN BY WHITE HOUSE Here is the image of that cover via New York Daily News Twitter:Of course, The New York Daily News isn t the first to go after Spicer for these remarks. The Anne Frank Center has called on Donald Trump to fire Spicer, as has House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Further, this is part of a disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism from Team Trump. During the campaign he regularly retweeted white supremacists, most infamously when he tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton over a pile of money with a Star of David that said,  Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.  This tweet caused such an uproar that House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to speak out about it. After he was elected, Trump s White House deliberately left any mention of Jewish people out of their Holocaust Remembrance Day statement. And, of course, no one can forget that we have avowed white supremacists working in the West Wing.To that end, if this administration doesn t want to be called bigots, they need to stop acting like it. Get rid of the racists, homophobes, xenophobes, and other assorted overtly bigoted people.Don t hold your breath on that one, though. We ll have four years of this kind of stuff. The only silver lining may be that in the end, the GOP can no longer say that they don t traffic in bigotry, since it s right there in the White House for all to see, while their party is in charge.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\",\n          \"Government News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"April 21, 2017\",\n          \"February 23, 2017\",\n          \"April 12, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obama\\u2019s healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBO\\u2019s assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes. \\u201cI think most of the taxes are going to go away,\\u201d Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate\\u2019s No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday. \\u201cOur members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue.\\u201d Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed.  Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans\\u2019 healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacare\\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the law\\u2019s taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said.  Some of Obamacare\\u2019s taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.  \\u201cThere\\u2019s no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now,\\u201d Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal. \\u201cThink of me with a Rubik\\u2019s cube, sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to 50,\\u201d McConnell said.  \",\n          \"Crooked Hillary has met her match:  Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund.
